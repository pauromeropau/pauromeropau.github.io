We're preparing our annual conference. For this conference, we've decided to create a new [landing page](https://app.zeplin.io/project/601d2c1a8cb86619e93fa53e/screen/601d2d857d5d7c8e6f61faaa) (u: `cartotest`
pw: `UIdev1234`) that will keep all the information of the event and past events.

This technical test will require you to build a very simple page that will look as shown in this mockup. You're free to add animations or anything you consider that will improve the usability of the page. You can download the sketch file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U5zvikutb0yb9jdVKkwEH1jgrXCQ6RaO/view?usp=sharing).

Here are some tips to help you with the exercise:

-   Don't focus on the content. Use Lorem Ipsum and placeholder images if you want to, but don't waste time on it.

-   On that topic, think about how you can make it easier for non-technical people to add new content to the site (videos, text, images, etc).

-   For the videos, when you click on them ideally it should open a modal to play the video (it can play any youtube video you want, like [this one for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)). We leave the style of the modal up to you.

-   If you use Javascript, we like it to be as simple as possible. No libraries, or other components, just vanilla Javascript.

-   Use Jekyll, Hugo or any other framework that makes you feel comfortable. Ideally the result should be only a static page.

-   Focus on details, we love details, designers love details.

-   We might try your website on mobile (wink, wink).

-   Even if the technical test is short, think on how things would scale and evolve with time when coding your CSS. We want to see your own code, so avoid using third party libraries.

-   You can use SCSS if you want to.

-   Create a README.md file explaining how to install the development environment.

We estimate that this test will take around 2 hours from your time, but please don't take this as a rule.

When finished, please:

-   Send us the link to your repository.

-   Feel free to reach out to us anytime (through jmartincorral@carto.com) while doing the exercise. We like people who ask for help rather than people that get stuck forever.
